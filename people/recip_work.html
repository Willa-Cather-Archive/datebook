          <h3>Recipients and Works</h3>
          <p>The below visualization shows relationships between Cather's recipients and the works Cather wrote to them about. To determine the people and works displayed in the network, I selected the people Cather wrote to most frequently (top 20 most frequent) and among those, selected the recipients who she wrote to about her works most frequently (top 10 relatively most frequent). I did this to ensure that their were many meaningful connection on the graph. For example, if I had simply selected the recipients who Cather wrote to relatively most frequently about her own work, I would have ended up with recipients who Cather perhaps wrote to two or three times. All of these letters would have contained references to Cather's work (e.g. 100% of the letters to that recipient contain a reference) but there would not be many letters to pull from. Conversely, just looking at the people she wrote to most frequently would not have ensured a rich and comparible number of references to her own work.</p> 
          <p>Recipients are represented as green circles or nodes. The grey nodes represent the works Cather writes to these people about (the top 10 works for each person). So, for example, we can see that Cather frequently writes to both Zoe Akins and Elizabeth Shepley Sergeant about "The Bohemian Girl." It is important to note that this graph is not exhaustive: e.g. Cather may very well write to her brother Roscoe Cather about "The Bohemain Girl," but it is not one of his "top" connections. The graph is interactive and you can pull and reposition each node to get a better look. The thickness of each line represents the frequency of the connection. The graph is intended to help spark discussion and provide another way for users to navigate and explore Cather's correspondence.</p><p></p></div>
