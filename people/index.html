The grey nodes represent the works Cather writes to these people about (the top 10 works for each person). So, for example, we can see that Cather frequently writes to both Zoe Akins and Elizabeth Shepley Sergeant about "The Bohemian Girl." It is important to note that this graph is not exhaustive: e.g. Cather may very well write to her brother Roscoe Cather about "The Bohemain Girl," but it is not one of his "top" connections. The graph is interactive and you can pull and reposition each node to get a better look. The thickness of each line represents the frequency of the connection. The graph is intended to help spark discussion and provide another way for users to navigate and explore Cather's correspondence.</p></div>
